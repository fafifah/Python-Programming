# Object oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code and data into reusable and modular structures called objects. It provides a powerful and intuitive way to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.

At the core of OOP are four key principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles help in structuring code and promoting code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility.

Encapsulation involves bundling data and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit, known as an object. It allows us to hide the internal workings of an object and only expose a well-defined interface. This improves code organization and security by preventing unauthorized access to data.

Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (child classes) that inherit the properties and behaviors of existing classes (parent classes). It facilitates code reuse and promotes the concept of "is-a" relationships. Child classes can extend or modify the functionalities of their parent classes, providing a hierarchical structure to the codebase.

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same method call, based on their specific implementations. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and understandable components. It allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object or system while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction helps in creating clear interfaces and reducing code complexity.

OOP promotes modular and reusable code through the concept of classes and objects. Classes define the blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data and behavior, while objects are instances of those classes. They interact with each other through methods, exchanging information and triggering actions.

OOP also supports important concepts like data encapsulation, where data is protected and accessed through defined interfaces; class composition, where objects can be composed of other objects; and design patterns, which are established solutions to common programming problems.
